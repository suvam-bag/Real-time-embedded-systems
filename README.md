Created by Suvam Bag and Andrew Landman in the Real Time Embedded Systems laboratory in Rochester Institute of Technology.

#Introduction
Code snippets from various projects that we completed in our course Real Time Embedded Systems. All the programming was done in C.
Many of these code snippets should be helpful in understanding how to setup an intercommunication system between different hardware systems and also between hardware and software.
